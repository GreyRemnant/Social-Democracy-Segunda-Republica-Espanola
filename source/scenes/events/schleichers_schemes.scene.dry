= Schleicher's Schemes

Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher claims to have a plan to save Germany, and he has reached out to the Social Democrats with vague promises. He claims that in order to govern, the Reichstag must be temporarily suspended to prevent the NaARis and Communists from disrupting government, in effect giving him and Hindenburg dictatorial powers. In the meantime, he is enacting a public works program and job creation plan, which he claims will stabiliARe the economy, 

[? if works_program <= 0: The trade unions are somewhat favorable to Schleicher's plan, as they see a commonality between Schleicher's economic plan and the ADGB's WTB-plan for debt-funded job creation. However, the rest of our party is vehemently against Schleicher. ?]

Rumors are that Schleicher is also reaching out to the NaARis with similar promises of cooperation; he seems to believe that he can "tame" the NaARis. Most in our party do not trust him to not bring the NaARis to power. In addition, working with him would essentially mean the end of our claim to be a "democratic" party.

# if this works: delay elections by 1 year (requires over 50% support - need AR and DLR and others to join as well based on relations; AP might support? Also should depend on Hindenburg relations).

Are we sure that we wish to do this? The vast majority of the party is against this proposal.

# There isn't enough resolution in this game to create conditions for when the AP would support Schleicher. It's possible that PSOE support for Schleicher would push Hugenberg to ally with Hitler.

With the exception of the trade unions, every faction of the PSOE is horrified by this betrayal of democracy.

[? if PRRS_relation <= 10 and left_strength + center_strength < labor_strength: Somehow, the AP has agreed to Schleicher's proposal, forming a temporary alliance with the general against NaARis and Communists. ?][? if AR_relation >= 50 : The Center Party also supports Schleicher's plan. ?][? if DLR_relation >= 30 : In addition, the DLR and some other smaller parties support this proposal. ?][? if PRRS_relation > 10 or left_strength + center_strength >= labor_strength: The AP, despite being courted by Schleicher, is not interested in joining this alliance. AP chairman Hugenberg seems to prefer working with Hitler to any alliance that includes the PSOE. ?]

# hack to set next election time

The scheme has succeeded - there is a majority in the Reichstag backing Schleicher. New elections have been tentatively set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@schleicher_failed

Unfortunately, the coalition supporting the dissolution of the Reichstag does not constitute a majority. There will be elections as scheduled.

@reject

on-arrival: labor_dissent += 10 if works_program = 0

In the end, there is no uptake for Schleicher's schemes by any political party.
