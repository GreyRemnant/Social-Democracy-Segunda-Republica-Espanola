= The Iron Front

The Iron Front is our new antifascist coordination front, consisting of the PSOE, the trade unions, and the Reichsbanner. How should we use the Iron Front?

[? if workers_PSOE < 45 or workers_PSOE < workers_JONS or workers_PSOE < workers_PRRS : Unfortunately, the Iron Front's effectiveness is dragged down by the PSOE's unpopularity, as the PSOE is no longer the dominant party among the workers. Many Reichsbanner members have left, and many workers are not interested. ?]

- @defense: Rally for defense against the fascists with the Reichsbanner.
- @pacifism: Rally for pacifism, against nationalism and war.
- @republic: Rally to save the democratic republic against dictatorship.
- @wtb: Rally for economic change and the WTB-Plan.
